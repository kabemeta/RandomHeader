# RandomHeader
small script i wrote so i could change the header image on my site.
<br>
<br>
add to the body of your page `<script src="./randoheader.js"></script>` and inside the js file you can change the picture links
<br>
i'm sure it's possible that it can changes specified images or even the background of the page
<br>
**Be sure to put the same id to the JS File, HTML and CSS**
