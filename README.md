# RandomHeader
small script i wrote so i could change the header image on my site.
<br>
(First time i publish on github sorry!!)
<br>
add to the body of your page `<script src="./randoheader.js"></script>` and inside the js file you can change the picture links
<br>
Be sure to put the same id to the JS File, HTML and CSS
